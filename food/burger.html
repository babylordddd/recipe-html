    <h1>Burger</h1>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef: Buy the best quality beef you can find, because for all our talk about the secret sauce, even the best cheeseburger is only going to be as good as the beef itself tastes. 80/20 ground beef is juicy and rich, I don’t recommend choosing a leaner blend for burgers. Chuck is great, or if you want a little luxury in your life, a chuck/sirloin blend works wonderfully.</li>
        <li>Buns: Don’t forget to get good buns, too! I am obsessed with the squishy, sweetness of Hawaiian burger buns, but use whatever type of burger bun you like best.</li>
        <li>Burger seasonings: Garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, salt, and pepper add extra flavor to every bite.</li>
        <li>Cheese: This is a bit controversial, but I use regular cheddar slices on my burgers. You can use processed, American cheese for a really classic, diner-style melty cheese situation if that’s what you’re craving.</li>
        <li>Lettuce and tomato: Crispy, juicy and a must-have.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Caramelize onions. If you’re making these burgers for a crowd, you can do this up to a week ahead of time.</li>
        <li>Season the beef. With a light tough, use your hands to mix in Worcestershire, garlic powder, mustard powder, salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Make burger patties! We typically do ⅓ of a pound of beef per person. If someone’s really hungry, they can always make it a double!
</li>
        <li>Grill those burger patties! Cook the burgers to whatever doneness people want. If you’d like, you can use a meat thermometer, you’re looking for 160°F if you want medium-done burgers, 145°F for medium-rare.</li>
        <li>Top with cheese! When you flip the burger, top it with cheese. That way the cheese has time to melt while the beef finishes cooking.</li>
        <li>Assemble the burgers! Everyone can assemble their own as they please but we highly recommend eating them with all of the fixings.</li>
    </ol>
